## node-webkit (NW.js) snap

NW.js is an app runtime based on `Chromium` and `node.js`. You can
write native apps in HTML and JavaScript with NW.js. It also lets you
call Node.js modules directly from the DOM and enables a new way of writing
native applications with all Web technologies.

This snap package skeleton allows you to easily import your node project into
the tree to make use of NW.js.
